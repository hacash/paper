==The Goal of HIP-5==

Hacash Diamond (HACD) is composed of 6 different letters, which constitute the key identifier distinguishing different HACDs. 
These six letters are randomly formed from "WTYUIAHXVMEKBSZN". 
In addition to each HACD's letter combination, the serial number generated, the address at the time of mining, the bidding fee, and the block height are also immutable. 
The purpose of HIP-5 is to add another immutable element to each HACD on this basis: visualization, 
to increase the investment and collection value of HACD and promote its brand identity.

==The Feasibility of HIP-5==
The Hacash White Paper emphasizes that “a block diamond is a string of data that is compressed and calculated by a 32-bit hash value to meet a specific format.
Each block can only contain at most one diamond (or zero, depending on the computing power)".

Theoretically, the 32-bit hash can determine the look of a HACD, as long as the following four basic conditions are met:

* Visual look is randomly generated as the literal value of a diamond.
* Diamonds of scarce visual look has greater value, as in the case of special letter.
* Visualization can not be determined entirely by the combination of letters.
* HIP-5 designers can not manipulate the probability of visualization for HACD.

The fairness of the HACD system will be ensured if all 4 requirements are met.

==Implementation of HIP-5==

Based on the above 4 conditions, three dimensions can be included in HACD visualization design: shape, facet, and color.

===Shape of HACD===

There are 9 HACD shapes, including 1 standard and 8 special shapes. 
The special shapes are square, circle, heart, triangle, teardrop, ellipse, rhombus, and hexagon. 
The shape of the diamond is determined by the last digit of the 32-bit hash: 0~7 are special-shaped diamonds, and 8~255 are standard diamonds. 
This scheme ensures the extremely low probability of generating a special-shaped HACD.

===Facet of HACD===

There are 16-17 facets for each HACD, and the facet pattern depends on the shape of the HACD.

===Color of HACD===

There are 16 color options

['041B2D', '004E9A'],    
['004E9A', '428CD4'],    
['8A5082', '6F5F90'],    
['6F5F90', '758EB7'],    
['8A5082', 'FF7B89'],    
['FF7B89', 'A5CAD2'],    
['F7D6E0', 'F2B5D4'],    
['E5C1CD', 'C9BBC8'],    
['EFF7F6', 'F7D6E0'],    
['F3DBCF', 'AAC9CE'],    
['AAC9CE', 'B6B4C2'],    
['F2B5D4', '7BDFF2'],    
['7BDFF2', 'B2F7EF'],    
['85CBCC', 'A7D676'],    
['daad7b', 'F9E2AE'],    
['F9E2AE', 'A8DEE0']。

Different HACD facets will be randomly filled with the above different colors, 
and the color depends on the HACD letter combination and the last 11 digits of the 32-bit hash.

==Conclusion==
The HIP-5's HACD visualization scheme is made up of 9 different shapes, 2 facets patterns (16-17), and 16 colors.
