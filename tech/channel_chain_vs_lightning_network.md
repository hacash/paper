Channel Chain Network vs. Lightning Network: A Comparative Analysis of Technical Points

The Hacash whitepaper, titled "A Cryptocurrency System for Large-Scale Real-Time Settlements," dedicates a significant portion of its content to describing the mechanism and technical implementation of the innovative "Channel Chain Payment Settlement Network."

However, the whitepaper's discourse is intricate and lacks a cohesive synthesis, making it challenging to grasp the technical focal points clearly. This document aims to offer a concise and direct comparison of the advantages, disadvantages, and characteristics of the Channel Chain Network technology by contrasting it with the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which also belongs to the category of state channel technologies.

The comparison will be divided into two sections: similarities and differences.

## Similarity

#### 1. State Channels

Both Hacash's Channel Chain Network and Bitcoin's Lightning Network fundamentally belong to Layer 2 technologies and fall under the category of state channel technologies.

Their basic principles involve utilizing the blockchain mainnet as an arbitration guarantee to support the security of massive off-chain payments through peer-to-peer interactions, all while enabling real-time settlement. The key difference lies in their specific technical implementations.

#### 2. Mainnet Channel Opening and Closure

Both require a small gas fee for opening channels on the mainnet, which is necessary for utilizing the payment functionality.

#### 3. Coin Deposits

Similar to bank deposit accounts, both systems necessitate that both parties deposit a certain amount of coins into the channel before conducting payments.

#### 4. Arbitration Challenge Period

When unilaterally closing channels, both require a waiting period (ranging from hours to days or even weeks) to serve as an arbitration period, ensuring that the party initiating the closure has not engaged in malicious activities, such as taking coins not rightfully theirs.

#### 5. Multi-Hop Payments

To avoid the impracticality and cost of opening a channel with every potential counterparty, both systems facilitate multi-hop payments. If party A has a channel with party B, and party B has a channel with party C, party A can transfer funds to party C without the need for a direct channel between A and C.

#### 6. Node Service Providers

Due to the demand for multi-hop payments, specialized node service providers emerge. These service providers handle numerous "intermediary payments" while charging nominal fees (in comparison to the mainnet) to sustain their operations.

These providers serve as a form of technological banks, and they also establish settlement channels among themselves. Regular users only need to open channels with one such "bank," theoretically allowing them to make payments to anyone else with a similar "bank account."

#### 7. Payment Routing

As the number of channels grows on a large scale, determining the intermediate nodes used in multi-hop payments becomes less straightforward and may require routing solutions similar to IP address routing or payment routing consortia.

#### 8. Receiving Capacity Limitations

Channels are opened by both parties, and the maximum amount of coins that can be received is limited to the counterparty's deposit. This holds true for both sides. If professional node service providers open channels with users, they must deposit a certain amount of coins for each user to receive payments. Transactions that exceed the counterparty's deposit cannot be processed.

#### 9. Proof of Settlement

After each payment, it is necessary to store and back up the settlement credentials generated by the payment. These credentials serve as proof of your balance within the channel, and losing them could result in a loss of funds.

#### 10. Privacy Concerns

In general, channel service providers can have access of all your transactions, posing a risk to your privacy. The Lightning Network employs techniques like onion routing to conceal the final payment path, while the Channel Chain uses technologies like "encrypted settlement networks" to enhance privacy protection.

## Differences

#### 1. Synchronous Payments vs. Asynchronous Payments

For multi-hop payments, the Channel Chain employs real-time synchronous payments, whereas the Lightning Network utilizes asynchronous payments.

Synchronous payments offer greater security, as payments either fully succeed or completely fail without intermediate states. In contrast, the Lightning Network's asynchronous payment method can result in situations where you pay your node service provider, but they do not forward your funds to the intended recipient, creating an incomplete payment.

In brief, Lightning Network intermediaries may potentially and effectively withhold your funds, while Channel Chain technology technically eliminates this possibility.

#### 2. Payment Routing Consortia

The real-time synchronous payment approach of the Channel Chain Network relies more on timely responses from node service providers, necessitating a regularly updated and effective routing table. Nodes may establish a non-profit routing consortium, akin to traditional internet domain name routing services (DNS). In contrast, the Lightning Network is more likely to employ less efficient but more decentralized routing methods.

#### 3. Credit Overdraft

Channel Chains support negative balances within channels, opening the possibility for node service providers to extend credit limits to users (similar to credit cards). Credit can be bidirectional, with service providers extending credit to users and users reciprocating.

#### 4. Service Provider Fast Channels

Node service providers, due to their handling of substantial customer payment demands, may adopt a "deferred batch reconciliation" approach. In essence, they do not immediately reconcile after each payment but accumulate payments, reconciling them in bulk after reaching a threshold. This enhances payment processing efficiency.

#### 5. Balancing Payments and Receipts

Hacash's whitepaper describes atomic balancing operations for payments and receipts within separate channels. This allows for the swift transfer of accumulated currency balances in the receipt channel to the payment channel, similar to transferring funds from a salary account to a spending account.

#### 6. Decentralization

Due to its technical characteristics, Channel Chain Networks are inherently more decentralized than the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network's asynchronous payment features may lead to an oligopoly or even a monopoly of node service providers, reducing decentralization.

#### 7. On-Chain Interaction

Through readable DeFi contract, Channel Chain-related processes can be directly interacted with and combined on the Hacash layer 1. For example, it is possible to pay service fees to a provider and open a new channel within a single contract.

#### 8. Capacity Expansion

Through on-chain interactions, coin deposits into channels can be expanded without closing the channels, addressing the capacity limitations mentioned earlier.

#### 9. Credential Backup

Due to the limitations of UTXO technology, the Lightning Network requires backing up every credential generated from historical payments to ensure channel balance security, resulting in significant inconvenience and storage space usage.

Channel Chain Networks only need to save the reconciliation data from the last payment, allowing for the discarding of historical data.

#### 10. Technical Architecture

Hacash's readable DeFi contract is more flexible and mature compared to Bitcoin's UTXO transaction structure, providing greater scalability and ease of financial operations. This opens up more possibilities for channel chain payment technology to meet a wider range of payment needs.

#### 11. Supported Currencies

Lightning Network exclusively supports Bitcoin. Channel Chain Networks support both HAC and BTC payments, allowing for simultaneous payments in both currencies.

In the future, channel chain payment technology may be applied to Hacash's L3 multi-chain, multi-layer scaling infrastructure, accommodating real-time payment needs for a wider range of currencies.
